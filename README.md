# Matrix-Operations


This code represents a Java program that performs various matrix operations such as generating two 4x4 random matrices,
calculating the transpose of each matrix, performing matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.



The program first initializes three 4x4 matrices: matrix1, matrix2, and matrixSum.
It then populates matrix1 and matrix2 with random integer values using nested for loops.
After that, it calculates the transpose of matrix1 and matrix2 and stores them in transpose1 and transpose2 respectively using another set of nested for loops.



Next, the program calculates the sum of matrix1 and matrix2 and stores the result in matrixSum using nested for loops.
Similarly, it calculates the difference of matrix1 and matrix2 and stores the result in matrixSub.



Finally, the program calculates the multiplication of matrix1 and matrix2 using three nested for loops and stores the result in matrixMul.
The resulting matrices are printed to the console using nested for loops and
formatted to display the matrices in a square shape with brackets surrounding the rows and columns.
